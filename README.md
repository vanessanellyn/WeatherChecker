# WeatherChecker

Welcome to WeatherChecker, a simple weather information application made using NodeJS.

## About

<p align="justify">WeatherChecker is a web-based application that allows users to check the weather information for a specific location. It leverages a third-party weather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather data. I embarked on this project as a means to familiarize myself with various JavaScript frameworks and broaden my skill set.</p>
